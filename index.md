# Computational Linguistics and NLP Research in North American Linguistics Departments

This page highlights linguistics departments in North America where there is computational research aligned with the field of natural language processing (NLP). 
Such research would generally be published in [ACL Anthology](https://aclanthology.org/) venues.[^1] 
Universities are listed along with graduate programs and research areas of full-time faculty affiliated with linguistics.
